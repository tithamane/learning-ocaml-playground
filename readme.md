## What is this?
This repo will hold all my ocaml "katas" that I will use to learn the language. I'll go through an ocaml book but I learn better by doing. I will avoid a lot of checks as these are katas. The only checks included are those that add on to my learning.

Hopefully I'll use ocaml in real projects in future but for now I hope it will help me think differenntly,.
